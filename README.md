# The back-end of a simple chat application

[This](https://dbdiagram.io/d/673444b8e9daa85aca437739) is the schema design made in [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io)

This is the back-end of a simple chat application I am making as practise and to also learn more about the changes in Rails 8, mostly SolidCable.
If you wish to clone and run this:
* Ruby version 3.2.0
* Rails version 8.0.0
* Then just `bundle install` and `rails s` and it should be up and running, you may also want the [front-end]() (which has yet to be made.)
